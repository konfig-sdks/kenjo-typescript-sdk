/*
Kenjo API

Before starting to use the Kenjo API, you have to request the API activation for a sandbox or production environment to the Kenjo Customer Success team. After that, an admin user has to go to *Settings > Integrations > API keys*, to generate the **API Key**. Follow the steps described in the **Autentication section** of this document. <br>The API key is needed to request the bearer token. Each endpoint callout requires a valid bearer token in the Authorization header. Once the token is retrieved, it will be useful during the time limit indicated by the 'expiration date'.
